* Sprinkle chaat masala right before serving for an extra zing.



## Notes on using Tenderizing
 👇

### 🧂 If using commercial meat tenderizer (like *McCormick*, *Shan*, or *National*)

* Use **½ teaspoon per 500 g meat**, so **1 teaspoon for 1 kg lamb chops**.
* Mix it **into the first lemon–ginger–garlic rub**, not the yogurt marinade.
* Let it sit for **30 minutes (max 1 hour)** at room temperature.

  > ⚠️ Don’t exceed that — longer contact can make the outer layer too soft or grainy.

After that, proceed with the yogurt-spice marinade as usual and refrigerate.

---

### 🧄 Alternative natural tenderizers

If you’d rather skip the chemical one:

* **Raw papaya paste** – 1 tsp per 500 g meat, marinate 30–45 min.
* **Kiwi or pineapple puree** – 1 tbsp per 500 g meat, marinate 15–20 min (they’re powerful!).
* **Lemon juice + yogurt combo** (as in the recipe) also tenderizes naturally, just slower.

---

### 💡 Best practice for Ninja Foodi / oven grilling

* Start with **Roast mode (190 °C, 8–10 min)** to gently cook through.
* Then switch to **High Grill (230 °C, 4–5 min per side)** to finish with a char.
