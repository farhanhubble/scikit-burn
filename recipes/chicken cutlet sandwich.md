* Panko breadcrumbs – ½ cup
* Neutral oil (avocado/vegetable) – 2–3 tbsp for shallow fry

**Pesto mayo**

* Basil pesto – 3 tbsp
* Mayonnaise – 2 tbsp
* Lemon juice – 1 tsp

**Assembly**

## 🔪 Prep

1) **Season & bread**  
   Pat the cutlets dry. Season both sides with salt and pepper.  
   Set up 3 shallow bowls: (1) flour, (2) beaten egg, (3) panko.  
   Dredge each cutlet in flour → egg → panko. Press crumbs on firmly; rest on a rack 5–10 min so the coating sets.

2) **Pesto mayo**  
   Stir pesto, mayo, and lemon juice together. Adjust salt/pepper to taste.

## 🔥 Ninja Foodi XL Grill (Roast mode, shallow fry)

1. **Preheat**: Insert the crisper pan. Select **Roast** at **190 °C / 375 °F**. Preheat 5 minutes.
2. **Oil**: Add **2–3 tbsp oil** to the hot crisper pan; heat 1 minute until shimmering.
3. **Cook**: Place cutlets in a single layer. Cook **4 minutes**, spray or drizzle a little oil on top, then flip and cook **3–4 minutes** until deep golden and the thickest part hits **74 °C / 165 °F**.
4. **Extra-crisp option**: Switch to **Air Crisp** at **200 °C / 390 °F** for **1–2 minutes** after roasting.
5. **Rest**: Move cutlets to a rack or plate for 3–5 minutes to stay crunchy.

> Tip: Roast mode keeps the oil shallow and even; Air Crisp at the end gives the “fried” finish without soaking more oil.

## 🥪 Assemble

1. **Toast bread**: While the chicken rests, toast the cut sides of the rolls in the Foodi on **Grill (High)** for 1–2 minutes or in a pan with a touch of oil.
2. **Layer**: Spread pesto mayo on both sides. Add arugula/lettuce, chicken cutlet, tomato slices, and mozzarella. Add a swipe of extra pesto if you like.
3. **Melt (optional)**: Close the sandwich and warm on **Grill (Low)** or **Roast** for 1–2 minutes just to soften the mozzarella—don’t overdo it or the crust will sog.

Enjoy hot with chips or a simple green salad. For make-ahead, keep cutlets and pesto mayo separate; assemble and rewarm cutlets in Air Crisp for 2 minutes before serving.
