## Steps

1. **Prep the Turnips**

   * Peel and cut the turnips into batons or cubes.
   * Sprinkle **2 tbsp salt + 1 tsp turmeric**, mix, and leave in a colander for **8–12 hours (overnight)** so they release water.
   * Next day, squeeze out the water. Spread on a clean kitchen towel or tray and let them **air-dry for 2–3 hours** (you can speed this up by using your **Ninja Foodi grill on "dehydrate"** or oven at **60–70°C** for 1 hour).

2. **Roast & Grind Spices**

   * Lightly roast **mustard seeds, methi, and saunf** in a dry pan until fragrant (1–2 mins).
   * Grind coarsely (not fine powder).

3. **Fry Garlic & Temper Spices**

   * Heat **200 ml mustard oil** until it smokes. Cool slightly.
   * Add **hing, garlic cloves, and green chilies**. Fry until lightly golden.
   * Add the roasted spice mix + kalonji + red chili powder. Stir for 30 seconds on low.

4. **Combine Everything**

   * Add the dried turnip pieces into the spice-oil mixture. Mix well so each piece is coated.
   * Add **100 ml vinegar**, stir, and cook on very low heat for 2–3 mins (don’t soften the turnips too much).

5. **Cool & Store**

   * Let the pickle cool completely.
   * Store in a **clean, dry glass jar**. Keep in sunlight for 2–3 days, shaking daily. After that, store in a cool, dry place.

Would you like me to also give you a **shortcut 1-day version** (using microwave + grill) so you can eat it almost immediately instead of waiting days for sun-drying?
